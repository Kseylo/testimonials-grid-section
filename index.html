                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
                        learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
                        joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                        bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and
                        have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                        here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
                        12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                        life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
                        switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                        startup. ”
